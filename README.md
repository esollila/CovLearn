# Covariance Learning 
Code (both MATLAB and python functions) for the <b>Covariance Learning Orthogonal Matching Pursuit</b> (CL-OMP)  method proposed in [1]. Also demo simulation that reproduces Figure 1 in paper [1] is provided. Comparison in the simulation study is also made to SOMP, and a function to compute it is also provided.
